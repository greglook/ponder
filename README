Ponder Library
==============
This library provides interfaces to generically model problem and solution
spaces, as well as strategies for searching the solution space effectively.


Function Optimization
---------------------
Function optimization is a search for a combination of parameters which minimize
or maximize some ordinal quantity (commonly a scalar _score_ or _cost_) assigned
by an objective function.

The two fundamental data types are a point in the _domain_ being searched and
the _result_ returned by objective evaluation. In order to utilize the library
strategies, two classes must be implemented:
* A +Domain+ implementing methods for exploring the search space
* An +Objective+ function to provide evaluation results


Function Approximation
----------------------
Function approximation is the problem of finding a function (f) that
approximates a target function (g), where typically the approximated function
is selected based on a sample of observations (x, also referred to as the
training set) taken from the unknown target function.
